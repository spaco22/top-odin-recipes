        <h4>Prepare the Dough in Bread Maker</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the sourdough starter, water, olive oil, bread flour, whole wheat flour, and salt to the bread maker pan</li>
            <li>Set the bread maker to the dough cycle and start. This will mix and knead the dough</li>
        </ul>
        
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>First Rise</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the dough cycle is complete, leave the dough in the bread maker to rise until it 
                has doubled in size. This can take 3-4 hours, depending on the temperature and activity of your starter</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Shape the Dough</h4>
        <ul><li>Remove the dough from the bread maker and place it on a lightly floured surface</li>
            <li>Shape it into a round loaf and let it rest for 20 minutes</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Prepare the Crock Pot</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>Line the crock pot with parchment paper</li>
        <li>Place the shaped dough into the crock pot</li>
       </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Second Rise</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>preheat the oven to 400F</li>
            <li>Cover the crock pot with a lid and let the dough rise again until it has doubled in size, about 1-2 hours</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Bake the Bread</h4>
        <ul><li>Set the crock pot to high and bake for about 2 hours. Check the internal temperature; it should be at least 
                200°F (93°C) when done</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Cool the Bread</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the bread from the crock pot and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
