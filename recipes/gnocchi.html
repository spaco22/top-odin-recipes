<p>a simple, vegan gnocchi recipe to make gnocchi from scratch!</p>

<p>this recipe only requires three ingredients</p>

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds russet potatoes</li>
    <li>1 1/2 - 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h2>instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Peel the potatoes and cut into 1-inch chunks. Boil in salted water until very tender, about 15-20 minutes. Drain well.</li>
    <li>While the potatoes are still hot, pass them through a potato ricer or mash them very well with a potato 
        masher until no lumps remain. Spread the riced potatoes out on a clean surface to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle 1 1/2 cups of the flour and the salt over the potatoes. Use your hands to gently knead the mixture 
        until it comes together into a soft dough, adding a bit more flour if needed. Be careful not to overwork the dough. </li>
    <li>Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope about 3/4-inch thick. Cut the ropes into 1-inch pieces to form the gnocchi.</li>
    <li>If desired, roll each gnocchi over the tines of a fork to create ridges. Place the formed gnocchi on a floured baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Working in batches, boil the gnocchi until they float to the surface, 
        about 2-3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>
    <li>Serve the gnocchi immediately with your favorite sauce. Enjoy!</li>
